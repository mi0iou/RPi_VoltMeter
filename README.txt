RPI Volt Meter

The RPi VoltMeter is a very simple Python program that allows the user
to measure a voltage  of up to 2 V DC using the Raspberry Pi Wobbulator
hardware. The voltage is measured by the onboard ADC chip, which has
four input channels. Two of the channels are used by the RPi Wobbulator
but it is useful to measure the no-signal voltage on these channels for
the purpose of setting up and adjusting the RPi Wobbulator. The other
two input channels are accesses by PCB pins on the RPi Wobbulator PCB
and may be used to measure any external voltage.
